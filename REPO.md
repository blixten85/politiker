# REPO.md

This is the repository governance document for `Avkroken/Politiker`. `Avkroken/.github/AGENTS.md` defines the shared organization-wide agent policy and defaults. This `REPO.md` defines the repository-specific requirements, technical contracts, invariants, validation rules, constraints, and operating instructions for this repository. Read both documents together. For matters specific to this repository, this document is authoritative unless live GitHub enforcement requires otherwise; the central defaults continue to apply where this document does not specialize them.

## Repository architecture

`politiker` is a web service where users connect their own mail account and send personalized messages to elected representatives.

- `app/`: Cloudflare Worker with `fetch`, `queue` and `scheduled` handlers.
- `log-archive/`: Tail Worker that archives `app/` log events to R2.
- `shared/`: shared validation, encryption, SMTP, Graph and types.
- `infra/migrations/`: Wrangler-native D1 migrations.
- `kontakter/`: separate Python collection, normalization and verification of contact data.

Cloudflare D1 is the canonical runtime data source. Git must not be used as a production database, D1 snapshot or alternate Cloudflare control plane.

## Cloudflare control plane

- `app/wrangler.jsonc` is the source of truth for versioned Worker configuration.
- Secret values live in Cloudflare and must not be hardcoded or duplicated into GitHub Actions.
- Cloudflare Workers Builds owns normal production deployment from `main`; GitHub Actions must not duplicate production deployment.
- Worker `politiker` uses root `app` and deploy command `npm run migrate:production && npm run deploy && npm run verify:production`.
- Worker `politiker-log-archive` uses root `log-archive` and deploy command `npm run deploy`.
- The app Worker is the sole D1 migration owner. Schema changes use Wrangler-native D1 migrations under `infra/migrations/`.
- Do not introduce parallel migration engines, deployment wrappers or GitHub Actions that mutate production D1.

## Contact data

`kontakter/` is a data producer, not a Cloudflare control plane. It collects and maintains public recipient contacts.

### Architecture and data ownership

Cloudflare D1 is the only canonical runtime data source for contact data.

- Do not export live D1 back into Git.
- Do not commit CSV/JSON/SQL snapshots of the production database.
- GitHub Actions must not write directly to production D1 as a substitute for the contact-data tooling.
- Contact tooling must not provision schema, resources or Workers.
- D1-writing helper scripts use the minimum necessary API token and may modify contact data only.

### Tech stack

- Python 3
- Playwright/headless Chromium for browser-required sources
- `pypdf` for PDF-based representative lists
- Docker/Docker Compose for the heavier municipality/region scraper

### Structure

```text
kontakter/scraper/scraper.py             municipality/region main logic
kontakter/scraper/regioner.json          source configuration
kontakter/scraper/politiker_common.py    shared normalization helpers
kontakter/scraper/d1.py                  limited D1 client for contact data
kontakter/scraper/sync_to_d1.py          municipality/region -> D1
kontakter/scraper/backfill_assignments.py organizations/committees -> D1
kontakter/scraper/fetch_*.py             other external sources -> D1
kontakter/scraper/quarterly_refresh.sh    orchestrates full contact refresh
kontakter/verify/                        verification tools
kontakter/resultat/                      local scraper/review artifacts
```

### D1 configuration

Scripts that need D1 use `kontakter/scraper/d1.py` (`D1Client`). Canonical environment variables are:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_POLITIKER`
- `D1_DATABASE_UUID`

Backward-compatible aliases may remain only while required by a verified runtime. Do not add new aliases to mask configuration drift.

### Contact-data model and refresh rules

- Normalize each source to the minimum useful recipient data: name, email, area/level, party when verifiable, and relevant organization/topic association.
- Do not elevate raw administrative job titles into separate public filters.
- `kontakter/resultat/` contains local working artifacts for review/import; it is not a production backup or source of truth.
- `quarterly_refresh.sh` is the full contact refresh. It runs separately from Worker deployment and must not receive permissions to change Cloudflare resources, Worker configuration or D1 schema.
- Prefer official sources and deterministic normalization.
- A scraper must not provision infrastructure to solve a data-quality problem.
- D1 schema changes belong to the repository migration flow under `infra/`, not the Python scripts in `kontakter/`.
- Long-running jobs should checkpoint locally per source/region so they can resume without creating a second production database.
- TLS validation must not be weakened in committed code.

## GitHub Actions contract

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns `CI / required` and verifies app/log-archive plus Python tooling under `kontakter/`.
- `.github/workflows/docker.yml` owns `docker`, builds `kontakter/scraper` and uploads Trivy SARIF.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` invokes the pinned Release Please workflow from `Avkroken/.github`. Changes accumulate in a Release PR that passes normal checks and merge queue; only the merged Release PR creates and publishes the next GitHub Release.
- `release-please-config.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json` and `version.txt` are the repository release-version contract. `.github/release-components.json` lists the two first-party Workers shown in release notes.
- Pin third-party GitHub Actions to full commit SHAs.

## Application security invariants

- Every account-owned database query must filter on `account_id`; admin endpoints require explicit admin authorization.
- `MAIL_CRED_KEY`, SMTP passwords, OAuth secrets, TOTP secrets and session tokens are sensitive.
- Prefer least privilege and provider-native mechanisms over custom wrappers.
